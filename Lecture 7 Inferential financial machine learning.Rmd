# Scientific method in finance
- Now consider a researcher interested in modeling a dynamic system as a function of many different candidate explanatory variables. 
- Only a small subset of those candidate variables are expected to be relevant, however the researcher does not know in advance which. 
- The approach generally followed in the financial literature is to try to fit a guessed algebraic function on a guessed subset of variables, and see which variables appear to be statistically significant (subject to that guessed algebraic function being correct, including all interaction effects among variables). 
- Such an approach is counterintuitive and likely to miss important variables that would have been revealed by unexplored specifications.

---
class: middle
# Scientific method and FML
- An alternative approach would be to 
.blockquote[
### FML inference engine
Isolate the important variables, irrespective of any functional form, and only then try to fit those variables to a particular specification that is consistent with those isolated variables. 
]
- ML techniques allow us to disentangle the specification search from the variable search, a key weakness in traditional econometrics.

class: middle
# Machine learning as a scientific discovery tool
- ML provides intuitive and effective tools for researchers who work on the development of theories. 

- This is counter to the popular myth that supervised ML models are black-boxes. 

- According to that view, supervised ML algorithms find predictive patterns, however researchers have no understanding of those findings. 

- In other words, the algorithm has learned something, not the researcher. 

- This criticism is unwarranted.

- Even if a supervised ML algorithm does not yield a closed-form algebraic solution (like, for example, a regression method would do), an analysis of its forecasts can tell us what variables are critically involved in a particular phenomenon, what variables are redundant, what variables are useless, and how the relevant variables interact with each other. 

---
class: middle
# What is the role feature analysis?

- .acidinline[With the help of ML, feature analysts find which variables are able to predict a particular outcome]

- ML algorithms decouple the specification search from the variable search

- .saltinline[The patterns identified by feature analysts do not imply causation]

- Strategists/Economists must hypothesize the cause effect mechanism that underlies the pattern uncovered by feature analysts

- That hypothesis can then be tested, in order to discriminate causation from mere codependence

class: middle
# Feature Analysis versus Backtesting

- Backtesting is not a research tool but a validation tool
- By the time we backtest , research should have concluded
- Building a hypothesis through backtesting leads to selection bias and false discoveries
- The goal of backtesting is not to form a hypothesis
- On the contrary, one goal of backtesting is to deconstruct a hypothesis, and to prove the researcher wrong through counter examples.
- To form a hypothesis, first we must find the variables involved in a phenomenon
- This is the key role of Feature Analysis

.blockquote[
Backtest overfitting results from confounding **research** with **validation**.  The failure of most quantitative funds can be traced back to this basic misunderstanding of the scientific method

## Understanding p-Values

- In Classical Econometrics feature importance is assessed using p-values.

.blockquote[
The idea of using a p‐value for hypothesis testing was introduced by Fisher (1925). His idea is to objectively separate findings of interest from noise. The null hypothesis is usually a statement of no relation between variables or no effect of an experimental manipulation.The p‐value is the probability of observing an outcome or a more extreme outcome if the null hypothesis is true.
`r tufte::quote_footer("Harvey 2017")`
]

- Importantly, Fisher argues that the p‐value should be used in conjunction with other types of evidence when available.

---
class: middle
## Understanding p-Values

- Neyman and Pearson (1933) provide a different (and incompatible) framework that compares two hypotheses, the null and the alternative.

- They introduce the idea of a Type I error (false positive rate, or rejecting the null when the null is true) and a Type II error (false negative rate, or failing to reject the null when the alternative is true). 

.blockquote[
There was a fierce debate between Fisher and NP. Over time, Fisher's p‐value has been embedded in the NP framework in a way that often obscures its original meaning. NP introduced the idea of the Type I error rate, which is the false positive rate in repetitive experiments. The p‐value for a test statistic is compared to the Type I error threshold to determine the test outcome, creating a subtle link between the p‐value and the Type I error rate. As a result, people often mistakenly describe the p‐value as the Type I error rate.
`r tufte::quote_footer("Harvey 2017")`
]

---
class: middle
### Pitfall 1: Specification - Significance Entanglement

- p-values are typically computed on the estimated coefficients of a given model
- When the p-value is less than 5%, the variable associated with that coefficient is deemed statistically significant, under the assumption that the model is correctly specified
- Thus, p-values cannot tell us whether a variable is significant per se. 
- glowinline[They cannot decouple the specification search from the significance search]
- In finance, where systems are so complex that researchers can only guess the correct specification, p-values are likely to lead to false conclusions

---
class: middle
### Pitfall 2: In-Sample Estimates
.pull-left[
- Least squares regressions attempt to adjudicate variance in-sample, not forecast
* .glowinline[Informational leakage: Each observation is used for fitting the model and evaluating the model]

* p-values are derived from estimation errors (in-sample), not generalization errors (out-of- sample) 
* A variable that appears to be significant may indeed have little predictive power
* In this example, an OLS regression (red line) attempts to minimize the in-sample error
* The p-value is low, even though the model gets the sign of the relationships wrong

]

---
class: middle
### Pitfall 3: A Dubious Probability
- In finance when we are dealing with high-dimensional data (many features), p-values become useless.
- When we are testing many *features* at the same time (multiple testing), the definition of a p-value does not provide a useful quantification.
.blockquote[
### Rethinking p-values in algorithmic investment
- Suppose that the probability of a backtested strategy being profitable is 1% (the ground truth)
- The quant analyst wants to test 1000 strategies and find the true profitable strategies, each strategy has a sample size of 100
- If thinks that using p-values<0.05 as a cut-off for choosing is a profitable.
- What are the consequences of his actions?

- What we really care about is a different probability: $Prob(H_1|X>x)$
]
]

---
class: middle
# Pitfall 6: P-hacking
- If hypotheses are tested more than once on a given dataset, the probability of a false positive exceeds $\alpha$
- Selecting the model with lowest p-values out of multiple trials leads to selection bias
- In finance, where datasets are limited, it is highly likely that a researcher reuses a datasets multiple times
- Virtually no paper published in financial academic journals controls for the number of trials involved in a discovery (K)
- It is highly likely that published p-values are artificially low (false positives)
---
class: middle
## Pitfall 7: Substitution effects
- In addition to correct model specification, p- values require (among other assumptions):
.blockquote[
– Uncorrelated predictors (no multicollinearity)
– White noise residuals
– Normally-distributed residuals
– No outliers
]
• In particular, p-values are not robust to multicollinearity (linear substitution effects)
• Because of this lack of robustness, important variables can be assigned high p-values, and be wrongly dismissed as irrelevant

---
class: middle
# The problem with p-values are not just p-values

- [Gelman (2016)](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/asa_pvalues.pdf) comments that problem is much deeper than p-value misue.

- He argues a scientific hypothesis in a field such as psychology, economics, or medicine can correspond to any number of statistical hypotheses, and if the ASA is going to issue a statement warning about p-values, I think it necessary to emphasize that researcher degrees of freedom—the garden of forking paths—can and does occur even without people realizing what they are doing. 

- A researcher will see the data and make a series of reasonable, theory-respecting choices, ending up with an apparently successful—that is, “statistically significant”—finding, without realizing that the nominal p-value obtained is meaningless.

- Ultimately the problem is not with p-values but with null hypothesis significance testing, that parody of falsificationism in which straw-man null hypothesis A is rejected and this is taken as evidence in favour of preferred alternative B. 

- Whenever this sort of reasoning is being done, the problems discussed above will arise.
- He concludes by saying there needs to be a paradigm shift towards a greater acceptance of uncertainty and embracing of variation.

# And finally
## What probability is more appealing?

- Which of these conditional probabilities is more intuitively appealing?

.glow[$$Pr(Data|Hypothesis) \text{ or }Pr(Hypothesis|Data)$$]

--

- The p-value is the probability of the compatability of the data with the null hypothesis, but we are usually more interested in the probability of the hypothesis given the data.

- If you recall, Bayes theorem can be used to achieve this at the expense of some additional assumptions (Bayes priors)

- The following sets up a binary random classification problem with 40 features
- five are informative (prefixed `I_`), thirty are redundant (prefixed `R_`), and 5 are pure noise (prefixed `N_`)
- Redundant features are those formed by adding Gaussian noise to a randomly chosen informative feature
- **The lower the value of `SigmaStd` the greater the substitution effective.**
- Finally the below fits a logistical classification regressions named `ols`

```{python}
import numpy as np

- In this example one informative feature and two redundant features are below the p-value<0.05 threshold.

# *black-box-ness* critiques

- The last few years has witness the rise of opaque decision systems such as Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)

- The empirical success of Deep Learning (DL) models such as DNNs stems from a combination of efficient learning algorithms and their huge parametric space. 
- The latter space comprises hundreds of layers and millions of parameters, which makes DNNs be considered as complex black-box models. 
- The opposite of *black-box-ness* is transparency, i.e., the search for a direct understanding of the mechanism by which a model works.
- Explanations supporting the output of a model are crucial, especially in finance.

# Interpretability and ML

- In general, humans are reticent to adopt techniques that are not directly intrepretable, tractable, and trustworthy. 
- It is customary to think that by focusing solely on performance, the systems will be increasingly opaque. 
- This is true in the sense that there is a trade-off between the performance of a model and its transparency. 
- However, an improvement in the understanding of a system can lead to the correction of its deficiencies. 
- When developing a ML model, the consideration of interpretability as an additional design driver can improve its implementability for 3 reasons:

1. .heatline[Interpretability helps ensure impartiality in decision-making, i.e. to detect, and consequently, correct from bias in the training dataset.]

2. .satlinline[Interpretability facilitates the provision of robustness by highlighting potential adversarial perturbations that could change the prediction.]

3. .acidinline[Interpretability can act as an insurance that only meaningful variables infer the output, i.e., guaranteeing that an underlying truthful causality exists in the model reasoning.]

# XAI packages
- With machine learning interpretability growing in importance, several R packages designed to provide this functionality. Two of the most popular are `DALEX` and `iml`.

- The iml package is probably the most robust ML interpretability package available.

### Advantages
- ML model and package agnostic: can be used for any supervised ML model (many features are only relevant to regression and binary classification problems).
- Variable importance: uses a permutation-based approach for variable importance, which is model agnostic, and accepts any loss function to assess importance.
- Partial dependence plots: Fast PDP implementation and allows for ICE curves.
- H-statistic: one of only a few implementations to allow for assessing interactions.
- Local interpretation: provides both LIME and Shapley implementations.
- Plots: built with ggplot2 which allows for easy customization
]
.pull-right[
### Disadvantages
- Does not allow for easy comparisons across models like `DALEX`.
- The H-statistic interaction functions do not scale well to wide data (may predictor variables).
- Only provides permutation-based variable importance scores (which become slow as number of features increase).
- LIME implementation has less flexibilty and features than `lime`.
- Replication requirements

# Data preprocessing
- Data and test ML models using raw data and lead to poor results and unstable inferences.

- For example, the surrogate tree function uses `partykit::cpart`, which requires all predictors to be numeric or factors. 

- Consequently, we need to coerce any character predictors to factors (or ordinal encode). 

- In our study we factorise the character variable `Sector` so it can be included to discriminate predictions across industries. 

.blockquote[
Specifically we do the following cleaning steps:

1. Keep only complete rows of observations which drops about two thirds of the raw data
2. Winsorize the data: to stabilise outlying variables on a multivariate distribution we follows the Khan et al. (2007) which stabilises potential inference via a bootstrapped least angle regression framework.

## Deep learning models

.panel[.panel-name[Deep nueral net machine]
- Deep nueral net machine learning models have been powerful prediction engines in finance. 
- With great powers comes great responsibility, and building **useful** models requires meticulous tuning
- We used a procedure emphasises parameter tuning by first using a random hyper-parameter search.  This is less exhaustive but more efficient than a full grid search.  
- For models with less tuning a grid search may be more appropriate. 
- Code to do this is avaliable upon request
]

.panel[.panel-name[Random Hyper-Parameter Search]
- Often, hyper-parameter search for more than 4 parameters can be done more efficiently with random parameter search than with grid search. 
- Basically, chances are good to find one of many good models in less time than performing an exhaustive grid search. 
- We simply build up to `max_models` models with parameters drawn randomly from user-specified distributions (here, uniform). 
- For this example, we use the adaptive learning rate and focus on tuning the network architecture and the regularization parameters. 
- We also let the grid search stop automatically once the performance at the top of the leaderboard doesn't change much anymore, i.e., once the search has converged.

# iml procedures
.pull-left[
- In order to work with iml, we need to adapt our data a bit so that we have the following three components:
1. Create a data frame with just the features (must be of class data.frame, cannot be an H2OFrame or other class).
2. Create a vector with the actual responses (must be numeric - 0/1 for binary classification problems).
3. iml has internal support for some machine learning packages (i.e. mlr, caret, randomForest). However, to use iml with several of the more popular packages being used today (i.e. h2o, ranger, xgboost) we need to create a custom function that will take a data set (again must be of class data.frame) and provide the predicted values as a vector.
]
.pull-right[
- Once we have these three components we can create a predictor object. Similar to DALEX and lime, the predictor object holds the model, the data, and the class labels to be applied to downstream functions. A unique characteristic of the iml package is that it uses R6 classes, which is rather rare. To main differences between R6 classes and the normal S3 and S4 classes we typically work with are:
- Methods belong to objects, not generics (we’ll see this in the next code chunk).
- Objects are mutable: the usual copy-on-modify semantics do not apply.
- These properties make R6 objects behave more like objects in programming languages such as Python. So to construct a new Predictor object, you call the `new()` method which belongs to the R6 Predictor object and you use `$` to access `new()`

# Model-agnostic techniques
- Model-agnostic techniques for post-hoc explainability are designed to be plugged to any model with the intent of extracting some information from its prediction procedure.

- model-agnostic techniques may rely on model simplification, feature relevance estimation and visualization techniques:

1. Explanation by simplification : They are arguably the broadest technique under the category of model agnostic post-hoc methods. Local explanations are also present within this category, since sometimes, simplified models are only representative of certain sections of a model. For example Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME).

2. Feature relevance explanation: techniques aim to describe the functioning of an opaque model by ranking or measuring the influence, relevance or importance each feature has in the prediction output by the model to be explained. For example SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlantations)

3. Visual explanation techniques are a vehicle to achieve model-agnostic explanations. For example PDP (Partial Dependence) ICE (Individual Conditional Expectation) and ALE (Accumulated Local Effects) plots.

## Feature relevance
.pull-left[
- We can measure how important each feature is for the predictions with `FeatureImp`. 
- The feature importance measure works by calculating the increase of the model’s prediction error after permuting the feature. 
- A feature is “important” if permuting its values increases the model error, because the model relied on the feature for the prediction. 
- A feature is “unimportant” if permuting its values keeps the model error unchanged, because the model ignored the feature for the prediction.

## Feature relevance explanations
- Permutation-based approaches can become slow as your number of predictors grows. 
 -To assess variable importance for all 3 models in this example takes 3 hours on a 52 core H2o cluster. 
 - Although this is slower, it is comparable to other permutation-based implementations (i.e. DALEX, ranger).

The following lists some advantages and disadvantages to `iml`’s feature relevance procedure.

#### Advantages:

- Model agnostic
- Simple interpretation that’s comparable across models
- Can apply any loss function (accepts custom loss functions as well)
- Plot output uses ggplot2; we can add to or use our internal branding packages with it

#### Disadvantages:

- Permutation-based methods are slow
- Default plot contains all predictors; however, we can subset results data frame if desired

- The procedure follows the traditional methodology documented in Friedman (2001) and Goldstein et al. (2014) where the ICE curve for a certain feature illustrates the predicted value for each observation when we force each observation to take on the unique values of that feature. 
- The PDP curve represents the average prediction across all observations.

# Interactions and the H-statistic
.pull-left[
- A wonderful feature provided by `iml` is to measure how strongly features interact with each other. 
- To measure interaction, `iml` uses the H-statistic proposed by Friedman and Popescu (2008). 
- The H-statistic measures how much of the variation of the predicted outcome depends on the interaction of the features. 
- There are two approaches to measure this. 
- The first measures if a feature ($x_i$) interacts with any other feature. - The algorithm performs the following steps:
.blockquote[ .small[
1. for variable i in (1,...,p) do
  -  f(x) = estimate predicted values with original model
  -  pd(x) = partial dependence of variable i
  -  pd(!x) = partial dependence of all features excluding i
  -  upper = sum(f(x) - pd(x) - pd(!x))
  -  lower = variance(f(x))
  -  rho = upper / lower
   end
2. Sort variables by descending $\rho$ (interaction strength)
]
]
]
.pull-right[
- The interaction strength ($\rho$) will be between 0 when there is no interaction at all and 1 if all of variation of the predicted outcome depends on a given interaction. 
- All three models capture different interaction structures although some commonalities exist for different models (i.e. DivYield, lg1R, Mom). 
- The interaction effects are stronger in the tree based models versus the GLM model, with the GBM model having the strongest interaction effect of 0.4.

# H-statistic analysis

- Considering $Invest$ exhibits the strongest interaction signal, the next question is which other variable is this interaction the strongest. 
- The second interaction approach measures the 2-way interaction strength of feature 
Specifically, if you have features $x_i$ and $x_j$, then you performs the following steps:
.blockquote[
1. i = a selected variable of interest
2. for remaining variables j in (1,...,p) do
  - pd(ij) = interaction partial dependence of variables i and j
  - pd(i) = partial dependence of variable i
  - pd(j) = partial dependence of variable j
  - upper = sum(pd(ij) - pd(i) - pd(j))
  - lower = variance(pd(ij))
  - $rho$ = upper / lower

class: middle 
# Two-way interaction analysis
- The following measures the two-way interactions of all variables with the variable of interest `Invest`. 
- The two tree-based models show Invest having the strongest interaction 
  - $\rho=0.75$ for random forest and $\rho=0.5$ 
- Identifying these interactions can be useful to understand which variables create co-dependencies in our model's behaviour. 
- It also helps us identify interactions to visualize with in other visualisation methods such as ALE plots.

#### Code to build interaction H-statistics and plot them
```{r ,eval=FALSE}
interact.glm1 <- Interaction$new(predictor.glm, feature = "MV") %>% plot()
interact.rf1  <- Interaction$new(predictor.rf, feature = "Invest") %>% plot()

- PDPs can produce erroneous results if the predictors are strongly correlated and are computationally expensive
- Accumulated local effects plot (ALE) circumvent some of these shortcomings.

- Second, ALE plots are substantially less computationally expensive than PD plots, requiring only $2^{|J|}\times n$ evaluations of the supervised learning model $f(x)$ to compute each $\hat{f}_{J,ALE}(x_J)$, compared with $K^{|J|}\times n$ evaluations to compute each $\hat{f}_{J,PDP}(x_J)$.

# Feature relevance explanations
- One fruitful contribution to this path is that of Strunbelji & Kononenko (2014) called SHAP
- sHapley Additive exPlanations calculate an additive feature importance score for each particular prediction with a set of desirable statistical properties which other feature importance measures lack.
- Specifically, local accuracy, missingness, and consistency.
- SHAP explains individual predictions using a method from coalitional game theory (Lundberg & Lee, 2016). 

---
class: middle
# SHAP algorithm
- The idea behind Shapley values is to assess every combination of predictors to determine each predictors impact. 
- Focusing on feature $x_j$, the approach will test the accuracy of every combination of features not including $x_j$ and then test how adding $x_j$ to each combination improves the accuracy.
- Unfortunately, computing Shapley values is very computationally expensive. 
- Consequently, iml implements an approximate Shapley estimation algorithm that follows the following steps:

.blockquote[
- ob = single observation of interest
1. for variables j in (1,...,p) do
  -  m = random sample from data set
  -  t = `rbind(m, ob)`
  -  f(all) = compute predictions for t
  -  f(!j) = compute predictions for t with feature j values randomized
  -  `diff = sum(f(all) - f(!j))`
  - `phi = mean(diff)`
  - end
2. sort $\phi$ in decreasing order
]

---
class: middle
# Shapley values computation
- The Shapley value ($\phi$) represents the contribution of each respective variable towards the predicted valued compared to the average prediction for the data set. 
- We use `Shapley$new` to create a new `Shapley` object. 
- The time to compute is largely driven by the number of predictors but you can also control the sample size drawn (see sample.size argument) to help reduce compute time.

```{r, eval=FALSE}

# Shapley values
- Shapley values are considered more robust than the results you will get from LIME.
- Recall that Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations are a technique for explanation by simplification.
- However, similar to the different ways you can compute variable importance, although you will see differences between the two methods often you will see common variables being identified as highly influential in both approaches. 
- Consequently, we should use these approaches to help indicate influential variables but not to definitively label a variables as the most influential.

# Summary
- In computer-age statistical inference, p-values are found lacking.
- The new AI revolution is in the development of responsible AI tools, with XAI being a central theme for responsibility
- In `R` we have a suite of tools to extract inference from machine learning models
- iml is probably the most comprehensive package available for global and local model-agnostic interpretation. 
- Although the interaction functions can become notably slow for wide data sets, the other functions are faster or comparable to existing packages (i.e. DALEX, pdp). 
- This is a fast moving field and some future research will be to dissect the main effects from the interaction effects.
